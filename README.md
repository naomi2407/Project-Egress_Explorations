# Project Egress_Explorations
So far, I have managed to achieve the very basic level of creating the primary header, the profile image of the user, the navigation bar, and began to create the icons. The content requires formatting in CSS to attain an aesthetical web layout. 
The next steps for the website is to complete the user's profile icons, links to the profile of different people the user has previously been in touch with, and another link to add new people they would like to 'meet'. A second webpage would generate a link after the user chooses a person, and be able to share that. 
When the user chooses the person they would like to meet, the website should be able to trigger a vibration or 'motion' on contact partner's phone by treating it as a sensor.
